# Exhaustive Research Methodology

When tasked with synthesizing or auditing a large collection of files (design systems, skill libraries, reference files):

## Rule: Consume Everything, Don't Sample

**Do NOT** read a few representative files and extrapolate. Read ALL files.

### Procedure
1. **List all files** first (`find`, `ls`, or tree output)
2. **Read every file** — don't stop at a "representative" subset
3. **Extract commonalities** across ALL files
4. **Note outliers** — files that break the pattern are important
5. **Cross-reference** — patterns in 90%+ = commonality; 100% = universal rule

### Anti-Pattern
- "I read a few files from each category" → WRONG
- "Read 5 of 72 brand files" → WRONG
- "Read all 272+ files and found 9 universal sections" → CORRECT

### For Very Large Collections (1000+ files)
Use `search_files` with targeted regex to find patterns across the full set without reading every file end-to-end. But always sample from ALL categories/sections.
