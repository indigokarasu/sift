# Sift

Sift is the system's general research engine, retrieving and synthesizing information from the web across a tiered source hierarchy — internal knowledge first, then free web search, then rate-limited semantic research providers for deep work. It evaluates source reliability through cross-source agreement scoring, extracts structured entities from retrieved content, and emits enrichment candidates to Chronicle so researched knowledge accumulates over time.

## Load-First Rule for Web-Adjacent Queries

**When the user asks about products, prices, reviews, how-to advice, or any information that requires current web data, load Sift FIRST before answering from domain knowledge.** This applies even if you think you already know the answer from training data.

**Why this matters:** On VPS/cloud environments, browser-based search (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) is almost entirely blocked by CAPTCHA from datacenter IPs. The `web_search` and `web_extract` MCP tools handle basic searches automatically via SearXNG. Load this skill directly for deep research, fact-checking, comparisons, or when the MCP tools' results are insufficient.

If you answer from domain knowledge without checking current sources, you may miss: product availability changes, new products on the market, updated formulations, price changes, or critical caveats (e.g., fabric-specific limitations like synthetic vs. cotton).

**Pattern to follow:**
1. User asks about a product/recommendation/how-to → load Sift
2. Run SearXNG: `curl -s "http://localhost:8888/search?q=QUERY&format=json"`
3. Fetch top result URLs with `curl -sL` or `sift.fetch`
4. THEN synthesize answer with citations

**Exception:** Pure factual lookups ("what is the capital of France") that don't require web data can be answered from internal knowledge.

## When to use

**LOAD SIFT FIRST — before any other action — when:**
- The user asks ANY question requiring current web data (not in your training data)
- The user says "search for", "look up", "research", "investigate", "find out", "check if", "look into"
- The user asks about products, prices, reviews, recommendations
- The user asks "what is", "how to", "why does", "when did" about current topics
- The user asks about current events, news, or recent developments
- You need to verify a fact or claim against current sources
- You need to compare products, technologies, or options using current data
- You need to fetch/extract content from a specific URL
- You're about to use the browser for ANY information-seeking purpose
- You're about to use `execute_code` to scrape a search engine

**In short: if you need information you don't already have loaded Sift first.**

Specific use cases:
- Web search and research synthesis on any topic
- Fact verification across multiple sources with consensus scoring
- Document summarization and structured entity extraction
- Comparison research across products, technologies, or options
- Deep research sessions with multi-source threading
- Product/price/recommendation research
- Current events and news research

## When not to use

- OSINT investigations on individuals — use Scout
- Image-to-action processing — use Look
- Pattern analysis on the knowledge graph — use Corvus
- Communications and message drafting — use Dispatch

Sift never performs OSINT investigations on individuals. If the primary entity of a query is a person, Scout should be invoked.

## Responsibility boundary

Sift owns web research, fact verification, and structured entity extraction.

Sift does not own: person-focused OSINT (Scout), image processing (Look), knowledge graph writes (Elephas), pattern analysis (Corvus), social graph (Weave).

## Ontology types

Sift works with these types from `spec-ocas-ontology.md`:

- **Entity/Person, Entity/AI** — people and agents identified during research.
- **Place** — locations, venues, and organizations.
- **Concept/Event, Concept/Idea** — events, topics, and themes extracted from research.
- **Thing/DigitalArtifact** — documents, articles, and digital records.

Sift emits Signals to Elephas for entities and relationships extracted with confidence >= med. Signal `payload.type` is the ontology type of the primary entity. `source_journal_type` is `"Research"`. Every emitted Signal must include a `user_relevance` field.

### user_relevance field

Every Signal emitted by Sift carries a `user_relevance` field with one of two values:

- `"user"` — the signal is relevant to the user's personal knowledge graph
- `"agent_only"` — the signal is agent-initiated research with no demonstrated user connection

**Default is `"agent_only"`** because much of Sift's research may be agent-initiated (scheduled runs, background enrichment, cooperative queries from other skills). A signal receives `user_relevance: "user"` only when:

1. The user explicitly requested the search or research (e.g., "search for X", "look up Y", or any direct user prompt that triggered the run), OR
2. The entity has a demonstrated connection to an entity already in Chronicle with `user_relevance: "user"`.

When in doubt, default to `"agent_only"`. Elephas can promote later if a user connection is established.

Signal example:
```json
{
  "signal_id": "sig-sift-20260402-001",
  "source_skill": "ocas-sift",
  "source_journal_type": "Research",
  "emitted_at": "2026-04-02T14:30:00Z",
  "user_relevance": "agent_only",
  "payload": {
    "type": "Concept/Event",
    "name": "2026 Solar Eclipse",
    "confidence": "high",
    "source_refs": ["https://example.com/eclipse"]
  }
}
```

Sift may read Thread's active context for query rewriting and Weave's database for entity disambiguation (both cooperative read-only; see `spec-ocas-interfaces.md` Cooperative Query Interfaces).

## Commands

- `sift.search` — execute a search query with automatic tier selection and query rewriting
- `sift.research` — run a multi-source research session producing a structured research journal
- `sift.verify` — fact-check a specific claim across multiple sources with consensus scoring
- `sift.summarize` — summarize a document or URL with structured entity extraction
- `sift.extract` — extract entities, claims, statistics, and relationships from content
- `sift.thread.list` — list active research threads with entity overlap detection
- `sift.status` — return current state: active threads, quota usage, source reputation summary
- `sift.journal` — write journal for the current run; called at end of every run
- `sift.update` — pull latest from GitHub source; preserves journals and data
- `sift.fetch [url]` — extract clean Markdown content from a URL. Runs Scrapling first (fast HTTP for static sites, headless browser mode for JS-heavy sites); falls back to Jina Reader (`r.jina.ai/<url>`) if Scrapling output is below content threshold. Returns Markdown with structure preserved. Use for summarizing a specific page or document the user provides.
- `sift.webwright` — execute an interactive web task using browser automation (Playwright Firefox). Write the plan, exploration screenshots, instrumented final_script.py, execution log, and self-verification into `{agent_root}/commons/data/ocas-sift/webwright/`. For form filling, multi-step flows, JS-heavy sites, interactive filtering, or any task where the browser is the workspace. Read `references/webwright-integration.md` before first use.

## Response modes

Sift classifies query depth automatically:

- **quick_answer** — simple factual lookups, single-source sufficient
- **comparison** — multi-source comparison with structured output
- **research** — deep multi-session investigation with threading
- **document_analysis** — URL or document-focused extraction

Users may override with phrases like "quick answer", "deep dive", "compare", or "summarize".

## Search tier selection

All configured search sources fire in parallel. Results are deduplicated by URL and content hash.

- **Internal knowledge** — LLM knowledge, conversation context, Chronicle if available. Always runs first as a pre-check.
- **Free web search (parallel fan-out)** — all of the following fire simultaneously:
  - **N2 MCP** (`n2_web_search`) — SearXNG-backed, no API key required. Registered during `sift.init`. Also provides `n2_news_search` for recency-focused queries. SearXNG aggregates many engines, but only a handful answer from a datacenter IP — the rest are CAPTCHA'd or rate-limited — so treat one call as a narrow sample rather than coverage of the web. Before concluding a topic is unfindable, check which engines are actually contributing:

    ```bash
    curl -s "$SEARXNG_URL/search?q=test&format=json" \
      | jq '{contributing: ([.results[].engines[]] | unique), failing: [.unresponsive_engines[][0]]}'
    ```

    A short `contributing` list means search is degraded at the engine layer; rephrasing the query will not help, so go to primary sources (`references/primary_source_research.md`). A degraded engine layer is easy to miss because the service still answers HTTP 200 with plausible-looking results.
  - **Brave Search API** — structured web results. See `references/search_tiers.md` for provider configuration and API keys.
  - **SearXNG** — self-hosted instance on `http://localhost:8888`. **This is the primary search source on VPS environments.** Always returns results when browser-based search is CAPTCHA-blocked.
  - **Platform search** — agent-reach on Twitter/X (via Mirror Rotator → Search Bridge), Reddit, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.
- **Google Custom Search API (CSAPI)** — fallback when free web search returns insufficient results. Uses `mcp_google_workspace_search_custom`. Quota-limited: 1,000 queries/month free tier. Check quota before calling (`csapi_quota.py check`), increment after (`csapi_quota.py increment`).

For detailed tier-by-tier workflow, API curl examples, and cloud environment fallbacks, read `references/research-workflow.md`.

## Quick VPS Search Cheat Sheet

```bash
# Primary — SearXNG (localhost:8888, no CAPTCHA)
curl -s "http://localhost:8888/search?q=QUERY&format=json" | python3 -c "
import json,sys
d=json.load(sys.stdin)
for r in d.get('results',[])[:10]:
    print(r['title']); print(r['url']); print(r['content'][:200]); print()
"

# Fallback — CSAPI (check quota first)
python3 ~/.hermes/skills/ocas-sift/scripts/csapi_quota.py check
```

## Source reputation model

Sift maintains per-domain trust scores based on: cross-source agreement, contradiction frequency, historical accuracy, structured data quality, citation frequency.

## Structured extraction rules

When pages are retrieved, extract: entities (with type from shared ontology), claims, statistics, relationships, citations. Each extraction includes confidence level.

Extracted entities are emitted as enrichment candidates for Elephas.

## Run completion

After every Sift command that produces results:

1. Persist session, entities, sources, and decisions to local JSONL files
2. For each extracted entity or relationship with confidence >= `med`: write a Signal file to the `signal` payload field in the journal entry. Use Signal schema from `spec-ocas-shared-schemas.md`. Every Signal must include `user_relevance` (see Ontology types section). Set `"user"` if the run was user-initiated or the entity connects to a `user_relevance: "user"` Chronicle entry; otherwise `"agent_only"`.
3. Write journal via `sift.journal`

## sift.fetch behavior

`sift.fetch [url]` extracts clean Markdown from a specific URL.

Do not use `sift.fetch` for general search — it fetches a specific known URL only.

## Chronicle interaction

Sift never writes directly to Chronicle. It emits enrichment candidates via Signal files.

## Inter-skill interfaces

Sift writes Signal files to Elephas (via journal signal payload): the `signal` payload field in the journal entry.

## Pitfalls & Tips

Read `references/pitfalls.md` for the full list. Key highlights:

- **Answer-from-knowledge trap:** Don't answer product/how-to questions from training data alone. Use SearXNG + fetch. (See Load-First Rule above.)
- **CAPTCHA cascade:** From cloud environments, ALL major search engines block headless browsers. Use SearXNG (`localhost:8888`) or CSAPI instead.
- **Credential sanitizer blocks API key writes:** The Hermes output sanitizer intercepts API keys. If CSAPI fails with missing key, the owner must add it manually.
